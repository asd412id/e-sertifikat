# e-Sertifikat - PDF Generator Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. File Naming Issue
**Problem**: PDF files were generated with generic names without participant information
**Solution**:
- Updated `CertificateService.js` to include participant name in filename
- Sanitized filenames to remove special characters
- Maintained backward compatibility with fallback naming

### 2. Font Family Loading Issue
**Problem**: Custom fonts from Google Fonts were not properly loaded in generated PDFs
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `PuppeteerPDFService.js` with improved font loading mechanism
- Added `document.fonts.ready` check to ensure all fonts are loaded before PDF generation
- Increased timeout values for better reliability

## Performance & Reliability Improvements

### Backend Optimizations
1. **Parallel Processing**: Implemented parallel processing in `CertificateService.js` to handle multiple certificates simultaneously (configurable concurrency limit, default 5)
2. **Resource Management**: Added proper resource cleanup and error handling
3. **Timeout Configuration**: Increased timeout values in `server.js` for long-running operations
4. **Memory Management**: Added resource limits in `compose.yml` for the app service

### Frontend Improvements
1. **User Feedback**: Enhanced `Certificates.jsx` with better user feedback during long operations
2. **Timeout Handling**: Increased timeout values in `dataService.js` for certificate generation

### Infrastructure Enhancements
1. **Nginx Configuration**: Updated `nginx.conf` with increased timeout values for certificate endpoints
2. **Docker Configuration**: Added resource limits in `compose.yml` for better performance

## Technical Details

### File Naming Convention
New filename format: `certificate_{participant_name}_{participant_id}_{timestamp}.pdf`

### Font Loading Process
1. Collect all unique font families from template
2. Generate Google Fonts CSS imports for non-standard fonts
3. Wait for `document.fonts.ready` before generating PDF
4. Include fallback mechanisms for font loading failures

### Batch Processing
- Process participants in batches of 20
- Add delays between batches to prevent system overload
- Provide detailed progress logging
- Maintain error tracking and reporting

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various font families (standard and Google Fonts)
2. Verify filename generation with different participant names (special characters, Unicode)
3. Test bulk certificate generation with large participant lists
4. Verify timeout handling for long-running operations
5. Test error recovery and cleanup mechanisms

## Deployment Notes

1. Ensure sufficient system resources (especially memory) for Puppeteer
2. Verify Nginx and backend timeout configurations match
3. Test certificate generation under load
4. Monitor resource usage during bulk operations
